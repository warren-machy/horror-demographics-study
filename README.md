## Introduction and Motivation
Horror has become the fastest-growing film genre, with its market share more than doubling from 4.87% in 2013 to 10.08% in 2023. However, a closer look at iconic films from past decades, such as <i>Friday the 13th</i>, reveals a troubling pattern:
<ul>
    <li><b>Males</b> are more likely to die or take on villainous roles.</li>
    <li><b>Women</b> are often underrepresented as protagonists.</li>
    <li><b>People of color</b> are less frequent in horror films, and when they do appear, they are disproportionately likely to die.</li>
</ul>
In light of these observations, our team has decided to conduct an analysis of gender, race, and violence in horror films. By examining patterns across various films from different periods, we aim to uncover the societal implications and biases embedded in the genre, and explore how these have evolved over time—whether for better or for worse.

The primary goal of this project is to raise awareness among the general public, as well as provide a concise summary of gender and racial biases for researchers, filmmakers, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics within horror movies.
